Perception is everything in the token arena. Much like in Plato’s allegory of the cave, many investors are trapped in shadows—misled by distorted projections of value from bad actors. In this piece, I will expose how VC-funded projects systematically engage in the following to make it easier to manipulate the price of their tokens:

- Keep the FALSE float of their token as high as possible.
- Keep the REAL float as low as possible (helps them pump the token).
- Pump the price of their tokens by leveraging the fact that the REAL float is very small.

## 

Moving from the low float/high FDV meta to the false float/high FDV meta.

Nooo, I'm not a low float/high fdv token! I'm "COmmUnITy FIrSt"

Earlier this year, memecoins skyrocketed in popularity, pushing VC-backed tokens off meta. These tokens became known as 'low float/high FDV'. With the launch of Hyperliquid, many of these VC-backed coins have become uninvestable. Instead of addressing their flawed tokenomics or focusing on developing real products, some projects chose to double down on keeping their circulating supply artificially low while publicly claiming the opposite.

Suppressing the float benefits these projects, as it makes price manipulation significantly easier. Backroom deals—where foundations sell locked tokens for cash and later repurchase them in the open market—become far more capital efficient. It also creates extreme risk for short-sellers and leverage traders, as a low real float makes these tokens highly susceptible to price pumps and dumps.

  

Let's get to some examples of what's happening. This is by no means an exhaustive list:

1. [@MANTRA\_Chain](https://x.com/@MANTRA_Chain)
	This is the most blatant one, for those wondering how it's possible for a project with only $4m in TVL to have an FDV north of 10b the answer is very simple: They're in control of most of the
	[$OM](https://x.com/search?q=%24OM&src=cashtag_click)
	float. Mantra holds 792 OM (or 90% of the supply) in ONE SINGLE wallet. This is not sophisticated; they were too lazy to even bundle the supply.

Now, how do we know what's the real float of Mantra?

We can calculate it by taking:

980M (Circulating supply) - 792 OM (The part of the float that the team controls) = 188M OM

This 188M OM number is probably not accurate either. The team still holds a significant part of OM that they used to sybil their own airdrop, rinse more exit liquidity, and further control the float. They deployed ~100M OM to sybil their own airdrop, so we'll be removing from the real float as well. You can check more info of that on the below:

This leaves us with... Ba dum tss... only 88M OM as the real float! (Assuming the team doesn't control more of the supply, which seems like a terrible assumption). This makes Mantra's real float ONLY 526m. A GIGANTIC difference from the $6.3B number they have on CMC.

A lower real float makes it easy to manipulate the price of OM and liquidate any shorts. Traders should be scared to short OM. The team controls the majority of the float and can pump and dump the price at will. It's like trying to trade against

[@DWFLabs](https://x.com/@DWFLabs)

on a shitcoin. I suspect that Tritaurian Capital—a company that

[@SOMA\_finance](https://x.com/@SOMA_finance)

(

[@jp\_mullin888](https://x.com/@jp_mullin888)

is a co-founder of SOMA and Tritaurian is owned by Jim Preissler, JPM's boss at trade io) loaned $1.5 million to—along with a few funds and market makers in the Middle East, may be behind the current price action. This further tightens the real float and makes it even more difficult to calculate it.

This likely explains their reluctance to release the airdrop and the decision to implement vesting periods. If they had gone ahead with the airdrop, it would have significantly increased the real float, likely tanking the price.

This is not complex financial engineering, but it does seem like a deliberate plot to reduce the real float of the token and pump the price of OM.

[@movementlabsxyz](https://x.com/@movementlabsxyz)

During their claim process Movement offered users that they could either: Claim their airdrop on ETH mainnet or claim on their non-existent chain for a small bonus. After a couple of hours of the claim, they:

- Added a fee for all claims on ETH mainnet, which was 0.015 ETH or $56 at the time on top of ETH's gas fee, this priced out most of the testnet users who had small balances.
- Reduced ETH mainnet allocations by more than 80% while keeping the fee.
- Stopped the claims.
- Restricted the claims between very tight deadlines

The result was obvious, only 58.7M MOVE claimed. So out of the 1b MOVE that was supposed to be claimed, only 5% was claimed.

Let's do the same thing we did with Mantra. According to CoinMarketCap, the self-reported circulating supply of MOVE is 2.450.000.000

[

According to Move's pie chart though, there should only be 2B (Foundation + Initial claims) tokens circulating post-claims so the shady shenanigans start here since 450.000.000 MOVE are already unaccounted for.

2.450.000.000 MOVE (Self-reported circulating supply) - 1.000.000.000 MOVE (Foundation allocation) - 941.000.000 MOVE (unclaimed supply) = 509M MOVE or $203m REAL float

The REAL float is only 20% of the reported circulating supply!!! It's also hard for me to believe that all of the 509M MOVE that are circulating are in the hands of users, but we'll leave it be for now and assume this is the real float.

What has happened during this time, in which the REAL float has been extremely low?

- Movement paid WLFI to buy their token
- Movement paid REX-Osprey for them to file an ETF for MOVE.
- Rushi went to NYSE
- Movement engaged in different shenanigans with funds and market makers and sold them locked tokens for cash so they could bid and pump the price.
- Team deposited 150M MOVE on Bybit at the pico-top. They probably started selling at the top since the token has been down only since.
- Paid a Chinese KOL shop 700k/mo before and after TGE so they could get listed on Binance and get extra exit liquidity in Asia

As CBB points out above, Kaito distributed their airdrop but only a small percentage of people claimed. This also affects the real float, let's calculate it:

Kaito has a circulating supply of 241M or $314m according to Coinmarketcap. I'm assuming this is number accounts for: Binance hodlers, liquidity incentives, foundation allocation and initial Community & claim.

Let's break it down to find out what the real float is:

Real float = 241000000 KAITO- 68000000 (Number of people who didn't claim) + 100000000 (Foundation) = 73M Kaito

  

The real float is equivalent to 94.9M Market cap, which is significantly lower than that reported by CMC.

Kaito is the only project on this list to which I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt as they at least have a revenue generating product and, to my knowledge, haven't engaged in as much shenanigans as the two other teams here.

  

Solutions and conclusions:

- CMC and Coingecko should be listing the real float of tokens, not whatever bullshit teams submit.
- Binance, et al should actively penalize this behavior one way or another. The current listings model is broken as you can just pay a KOL shop to increase your engagement in Asia pre-TGE as Movement did.
- Prices might have moved from the time when I wrote this article but for reference I take Move as $0.4, KAITO as $1.3 and Mantra as $6
- If you're a trader, stay away from these tokens as the teams can move the price whichever way they see fit. They control all the float and hence the flows and price of the token (NFA).
