Nunchi

#### 💁 Project Info

Description: Perpetuals for Yield: the Missing Link Between Crypto and Global Credit Markets.

Segment: DeFi

Network: Multichain

#### ✖️ Twitter:

#### 📊 Score: 152

#### 📚 Moni Discover:

🧙♂️

Moni’s Opinion/Moves:

Nunchi — a newly launched perpetuals exchange aiming to bridge crypto with global credit markets by making yield itself a tradable asset.

— Platform is live with initial support for yield-bearing perps (e.g. stETH), macro instruments (like VIX), and real-world credit derivatives (e.g. CLO tranches, bond spreads).

— Key mechanic: long yield-bearing perps receive native yield as funding; shorts pay.

— Liquidity is backed by an internal stablecoin collateralized by real-world debt assets (T-Bills, floating-rate loans), creating a credit-backed order book.

— Partners with Switchboard for real-time oracle data; focus on Asia for early user base.

— Roadmap includes expansion to BTC/ETH/SOL perps and deeper LST support via a unified liquidity pool.

A high-concept platform targeting onchain macro exposure, credit liquidity, and 24/7 yield speculation — early but already functioning with clear infrastructure and direction.

MilkIt

#### 💁 Project Info

Description: Next-Degeneration GameFi Platform on [@SonicLabs](https://x.com/SonicLabs)

Segment: DeFi

Network: Sonic Labs

#### ✖️ Twitter:

#### 📊 Score: 52

#### 📚 Moni Discover:

🧙♂️

Moni’s Opinion/Moves:

MilkIt is a gamified DeFi project on the Sonic blockchain, centered around P2P mining, digital farms, and a Ponzi-style referral structure.

— Farming mechanics: Users build farms, buy digital animals and barns. These assets increase your hashrate, which determines how much $MILK you earn per block.

— Mining model: Fixed supply of 63M $MILK, with a halving every ~53 days. Base reward is 7.5 $MILK per block.

— Tokenomics: 75% of all purchases are burned, creating deflationary pressure. The rest funds the reward pool.

— Referral system: 2.5% of mined rewards go to the user who referred the participant.

— Time-limited: Once the full supply is mined, the project ends. Currently in Phase 1.

Additional features include NFT-based inventory, asset upgrades, and farm customization, adding a competitive layer to user engagement.

grandmAIsters is a crypto-native chess game where players train and deploy AI agents to compete in automated matches, turning strategy into on-chain performance.

— Core gameplay: players build and upgrade chess-playing AI agents that battle autonomously. Wins earn rewards, while losses mean fewer earnings.

— Tech stack: powered by Solana and built on ElizaOS, with backing from AllianceDAO.

— Status: not live yet, but early access and updates are open via official channels.

Unlike typical NFT chess games, grandmAIsters focuses on AI-versus-AI competition, blending game theory, machine learning, and crypto incentives into one experience.
