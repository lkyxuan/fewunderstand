In partnership with Stablecon, we leveraged CB Insights’ Business Graph data to identify and map 172 high-momentum companies powering the stablecoin ecosystem across core infrastructure, consumer financial services, and enterprise solutions.

Funding to [stablecoin companies](https://app.cbinsights.com/cxn/202197/356697) is projected to rise to $12.3B in 2025 — more than 10x 2024’s $1B in funding. This unprecedented growth reflects several major developments in the space, including mainstream financial institutions entering the market, expanding use cases beyond transactions, and growing regulatory clarity worldwide.

In partnership with Stablecon, CB Insights has created a market map to help enterprises and investors identify high-growth markets and companies within the stablecoin ecosystem.

After analyzing 600+ companies, we selected 172 recently funded players that demonstrate strong momentum — as measured by CB Insights’ [Mosaic score](https://www.cbinsights.com/mosaic-score/), which assesses private-company health and growth potential based on funding data, personnel, market strength, and online sentiment. We then mapped these companies across 8 categories based on their primary focus.

### Key takeaways

##### 1\. Stablecoins are laying the foundation for a new era of crypto-native banking

Stablecoins are solving a key obstacle to cryptocurrency adoption: volatility. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins maintain consistent value through ties to underlying assets.

This stability has attracted major players in traditional finance: [Mastercard](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/mastercard-3) and [Visa](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/visa) now enable stablecoin transactions, while established banks [Societe Generale](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/societe-generale-group) and [Vantage Bank](https://www.cbinsights.com/investor/vantage-bancorp) have begun issuing their own stablecoins. Established blockchain infrastructure providers like [Zero Hash](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/seed-cx) and [Fireblocks](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/fireblocks) (founded in 2017 and 2018, respectively) are facilitating this mainstream adoption by providing technology geared toward enabling traditional financial institutions to integrate stablecoin capabilities.

Wallets & custodial solutions have experienced the highest average headcount growth (83%) of any market map segment over the past year. Examples include [Littio](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/littio) and [Open Settlements](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/Unknown), which offer custodial services that store and manage stablecoins on behalf of consumers while providing traditional banking features like payments and transfers. Another notable player is [KAST](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/kast-2), a stablecoin account provider that has increased its headcount by 10x YoY (to more than 40 employees) and secured $10M in funding in December 2024. KAST offers cards compatible with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and ATMs, and recently announced plans to evolve into a full-fledged on-chain bank.

Stablecoin issuers are also developing innovative approaches to address the limitations of USD-pegged stablecoins, such as [Ampleforth](https://app.cbinsights.com/profiles/c/YKa08) ’s cost-of-living-indexed stablecoins that adjust for inflation and [Ethena](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/ethena) ’s synthetic stablecoins that don’t require traditional banking reserves. Stablecoin issuers represent the largest category on the market map by number of companies and have the highest average M&A probability (24%) among segments. This signals high consolidation potential as the market matures and highlights the strategic value of stablecoin issuance to established financial players.

##### 2\. Liquidity & yield use cases are transforming stablecoins from passive stores of value into high-growth financial instruments

Stablecoins are evolving into yield-bearing tools and liquidity products, expanding beyond their traditional role as safer alternatives to high-risk cryptocurrencies. For example, established stablecoin issuer [Paxos](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/paxos) recently introduced a yield-bearing stablecoin, Lift Dollar (USDL). And following its $1.1B acquisition of [Bridge](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/bridge-12) last fall, [Stripe](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/stripe) added payment capabilities for Bridge’s USDB stablecoin, which generates yield through backing by BlackRock money market funds.

The liquidity & yield category, which includes liquidity mining, lending services, and yield-bearing stablecoins, has attracted $2.3B in funding across 40 deals over the last 12 months — the most funding of any category. Although $2B of this was a flexible, scalable credit line for institutional crypto lender and stablecoin issuer [Avalon Labs](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/avalon-finance), the funding intensity signals strong investor interest in this nascent category — the liquidity & yield category has the lowest [Commercial Maturity score](https://www.cbinsights.com/commercial-maturity/) of all markets, with companies averaging Level 2: Validating (i.e., introducing their products to the market through validation and testing).

The category’s growth potential is best exemplified by [StakeStone](http://www.cbinsights.com/company/stakestone), a cross-chain liquidity protocol that has secured 7 funding rounds since early 2024, while more than doubling its Mosaic score in just over 6 months (from 444 in November 2024 to over 900 in May 2025).

##### 3\. Cross-border payments are becoming the breakout use case for stablecoins, especially outside the US

International payments have emerged as a crucial application for stablecoins, with every company in the payments processing category supporting cross-border payments infrastructure. The role of stablecoins varies by region: in countries with robust traditional banking, they serve as specialized alternatives to fiat currency for specific use cases, while they provide more affordable and accessible USD alternatives in emerging markets.

This global appeal is reflected in investment patterns — among companies included in this market map, those based outside the US attracted more than half of all deals in the past 12 months. Major payment companies such as Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe have also entered this space through stablecoin card payments, transaction settlement, and analytics projects. This entry by established payment giants signals mainstream validation of stablecoin infrastructure and suggests that digital currency payments are moving from experimental to essential for competitive positioning in global payments.

The payments processing segment is relatively early in its commercial development, with half of the companies in this category still in the first 2 levels of Commercial Maturity (developing or piloting their products). However, these companies demonstrate significant growth potential — based on CB Insights’ estimates, we expect them to receive $454M in funding in 2025. That’s more than 10x the $45M they received in 2024, when excluding Stripe’s $694M round (the payments processor had not yet launched stablecoin payments at that point).
