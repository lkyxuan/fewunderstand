**Proof of Talk** @proofoftalk [2025-05-08](https://x.com/proofoftalk/status/1920494165307093492)

We’re excited to welcome Will Squires (@WSquires), Co-Founder & CEO of @MacrocosmosAI, to Proof of Talk 2025, joining 120+ leading voices in Web3 & AI.

With a diverse background spanning engineering, product strategy, and artificial intelligence, Will is now focused on building decentralized intelligence systems at Macrocosmos, a new venture building the world's largest distributed platform for machine learning solutions, building on #Bittensor and @opentensor.

Previously, Will led a transformative digital investment program at Atkins, resulting in the launch of an internal AI startup. His experience spans global infrastructure projects like Crossrail and HS2, and he’s held key strategy roles at XYZ Reality, helping bring 4D cloud-based project execution into real-world deployment.

At Proof of Talk 2025, Will will share his insights on the convergence of AI, infrastructure, and decentralization, building on Bittensor, and what it means for the next generation of digital systems.
