Crypto and the “trenches” are a once in a lifetime opportunity to genuinely change your life forever, and some people on this app decide to spend their time criticizing and hating on successful traders. Do not take the opportunity you have for granted. Block out the noise. Block out the retards on twitter crying all day, take this once in a lifetime opportunity and change your life forever.

Anyone who is on this app all day “calling people out” is actually just coping about them being an unsuccessful loser, who likely has no real accomplishments and wishes they had the life of someone else that they’re tweeting about

加密和“战es”是一生一次真正改变您生活的机会，该应用程序中的某些人决定花时间批评和讨厌成功的交易者。不要抓住机会理所当然。阻止噪音。封锁Twitter上的信号，整天哭泣，一生中一次抓住一次，并永远改变您的生活。  
  
整天都在这个应用程序上“召集人们”的任何人实际上只是在应付他们是一个失败者，他们可能没有真正的成就，并且希望他们拥有其他人在发推文的生活
