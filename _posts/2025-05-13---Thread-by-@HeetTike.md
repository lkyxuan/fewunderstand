for centuries, validation shaped how we organized; from roman empires to religions, from wartime medals to nation-state treasuries. every group had a symbol, and every system needed a way to coordinate.

today, that coordination happens on timelines. and it’s creators, builders, big voices, not institutions, who hold attention. they’re 1-person economies running on belief and bandwidth. but the vanity numbers of likes, follows or comments will eventually become obsolete. purely because of the shallowness & how the algo can now be gamed.

there was no further layer to these vanity numbers, till farcaster, base & noice came together.

> noice is a statement that the social graph can evolve beyond vanity metrics – into an economy where every interaction is a flow of value. we transforms likes, comments, and follows into programmable token flows.

let me explain this with an example: with usdc. on the left, is me,

[@HeetTike](https://x.com/@HeetTike)

an average user on farcaster.

each time i interact with my timeline (on the right), i'm tipping them 0.1 usdc or 0.01 usdc or whatever amount i set for all my interactions. whether it's me liking, commenting, quote casting, re-casting or following them, all will have different $$ amounts. simply said, my timeline will receive tips.

the flywheel

in turn, my community can utilise USDC to request access to my time (1:1 call, DM access) or distribution: follow them, like their cast, comment on their post, or getting on a 1:1 call.

now replace usdc with, say,

[$jesse](https://x.com/search?q=%24jesse&src=cashtag_click)

: a hyper-personalised symbol of a specific person (

[@jessepollak](https://x.com/@jessepollak)

) appreciating someone.

to get access to him, his distribution or his ideas. he creates

jesse. he tips

[$](https://x.com/search?q=%24woj&src=cashtag_click)

jesse with each interaction on x or farcaster. his community, either earns

[$](https://x.com/search?q=%24woj&src=cashtag_click)

jesse from him (or) buys it from the free market. each request for his time / distribution, leads to that token burning. (ie, if it takes 10,000

[$jesse](https://x.com/search?q=%24jesse&src=cashtag_click)

to get a recast from him, the 10,000 tokens will be burnt).

this is

[@timedotfun](https://x.com/@timedotfun)

's premise, but with a lot more velocity to the flywheel.

> a token is now flowing, each second, 100s of times, without a single unit's change in your behaviour of interacting with your timeline

we will take some time before we allow certain creators to launch their own tokens, so we can best provide the tool-kit beyond this flywheel.

- think coining all their content via noice,
- every holder of
	[$jesse](https://x.com/search?q=%24jesse&src=cashtag_click)
	being exposed to the upside of all his future content coins,
- a creator being able to delegate his token's tipping / burning access to others

we are iterating and experimenting. our belief is strictly for this to not be an aimless token launcher. tokens will be created, but it won't be a free-for-all like clanker or pump dot fun. that goes against our beliefs.

why farcaster? tl;dr, its permission-less, the behaviour already exists & we'll find our first 10,000 users there. this is why it's a critical piece to

[@noicedotso](https://x.com/@noicedotso)

working out. we are bullish that we'll bring 100s of creators on farcaster via the 1-person network states we enable.

inevitably, we will sprint our way to bringing this behaviour to X. (meta products are out of question, so we'll have to keep at bay).

the game plan

we test this with usdc on farcaster -> introduce creator tokens on farcaster -> bring the tip + access to X in a progra-magic way -> allow anyone associated with a token to set their tipping / price to any token they believe in.

we will ensure a user has to perform NO extra steps to tip (or) earn. we will always be in accessible via your timeline. agents, bots -- we know what we'll do.

our belief is that belief should be liquid. lol.

whether you're an employee at coinbase tipping

COIN or a superfan of

[$DRB](https://x.com/search?q=%24DRB&src=cashtag_click)

it’s for any tribe with a live token. imagine every group, from public companies to meme squads, using their own coin to tip, reward, and align. it’s programmable belief, not just programmable money.

we've already gotten 3 builders who will have tipping / access enabled with their already existing token:

our bet is that a

[$noice](https://x.com/search?q=%24noice&src=cashtag_click)

paired token can become the underlying currency of every meaningful social interaction on the modern internet.

we’ve shifted from nations to niches. we’re living in the era of one-person armies. the coder, the creator, the curator. you no longer need an empire to mobilize people. all you need is distribution and a reason for people to care. and just like before, every new-age community needs a treasury. that treasury is now social, programmable, and native to the internet. it’s your token.
